## That's Web Meme Generator

The following is a simple demo app demonstrating how to create a simple application that uses the power of Serverless to build a sweet meme!

This is a companion repo to my talk at Web Unleashed 2018 - We All Live in a Yellow (Serverless) Submarine

The application has 3 different directories.

### React app (base directory)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It is a simple application that allows a user to upload a webcam captured image to S3, and then polls that location for a meme generated by a lambda function and lets the user share it to social media.

It also allows the user to view 20 random images generated by others.

### lambda-put

The lambda PUT function is triggered when the user uploads the file to the specified S3 bucket. It composites an image onto the uploaded photo, pushes it to a public S3 bucket and makes record of the upload to a Serverless Aurora database.

### lambda-get

The lambda GET function is a simple endpoint triggered by a call to API gateway that pulls 20 random images from the database that can be rendered in the React application.
